# Gravitee FHIR policy
This policy allows you to transform a JSON payload to a FHIR resource based on the [HAPI FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/) library.

This plugin is heavily inspired by the article [Write your own policy with Gravitee.io API Management 4.0.0](https://dev.to/gravitee/write-your-own-policy-with-graviteeio-api-management-400-19k5) and the official gravitee plugin [gravitee-policy-assign-content](https://github.com/gravitee-io/gravitee-policy-assign-content/tree/master).
